1. npm install nodemon --save-dev
    nodemon -> don't have to restart the server anymore everytime you make a change

2. npm install express --save
    express.js -> framework to handle stuff easier in node.js

3. npm install body-parser --save
    body-parser -> parses the body of the request. if this is not used req.body would be undefined
    (express is special and sometimes removes this thing so install it)
